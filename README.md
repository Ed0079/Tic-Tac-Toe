#**`Tic-Tac-Toe`**
A very basic tic tac toe program with a super basic cpu op mode

Made with python and tinker

The yt video used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbRpDXV7QDM

The cpu is a random number generator with a loop that checks if the space that was randomly 
picked is empty & if the space is taken it will re pick a random number/space
